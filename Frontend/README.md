# Frontend

The frontend is built with React and every API call is handled through axios which sends the JWT token back to the backend on every request.

The editor is built using TipTap and the updates on real time are handled through SOCKET.IO. It also checks notification on real-time to see if a user has invited you to collaborate with him.
